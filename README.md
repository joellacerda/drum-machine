# Drum Machine

The Drum Machine is a web application that allows users to create music by clicking on virtual drum pads or by pressing the corresponding 
keys on their keyboard. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to fulfill several user stories, such as showing 9 
clickable drum pads, and playing audio clips when a pad is clicked or its corresponding key is pressed. Additionally, the app should display a 
string describing the audio clip when a pad is triggered. This project was bootstrapped with 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
